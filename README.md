# 🥒 MCPickle
A Plug-and-Play RAG Orchestrator for Modular Context Protocol Tools

MCPickle is a lightweight, open-source platform that helps Large Language Models (LLMs) dynamically retrieve, select, and invoke MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools — all through an intelligent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

With too many tools to manage and too little time to wire them together, MCPickle acts as your RAG-based router and tool sommelier: just describe your intent, and it’ll fetch the right MCP server for the job.

⚡ Features
	•	🧠 Intent-to-Tool retrieval via vector search + LLM planning
	•	🧩 Support for modular MCP tool descriptors (YAML/JSON)
	•	🔌 Plug-and-play interface: bring your own tools or auto-discover them
	•	🗂️ Built-in metadata registry for scalable tool orchestration
	•	🧪 Developer-friendly: test calls, log flows, and monitor usage
	•	🌱 Ready to grow: works out of the box, designed for extension

Whether you’re building agentic pipelines, AI copilots, or autonomous toolchains — MCPickle gives your LLM the context muscle it needs.

🥒 MCPickle: “It picks the protocol, so you don’t have to.”
